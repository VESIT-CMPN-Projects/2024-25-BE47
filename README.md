EnviroScan is a smart community-NGO collaboration platform designed to tackle the growing issue of waste, particularly plastic and mixed garbage. The app allows both regular users and NGO representatives to register and log in. Normal users can upload photos of waste-affected areas in their locality, tagging the location to request cleanup support. NGOs can then view these reports, assess the volume and plan collection drives accordingly. The object detection model (YOLOv12)accurately identifies various waste categoriesâ€”plastic, metal, glass, cardboard, paper, and trash. Additionally, NGOs can post updates, events, and awareness campaigns directly in the app, promoting community involvement in sustainability efforts. By merging real-time image analysis with grassroots action, EnviroScan bridges the gap between environmental need and organized response, offering an efficient and scalable waste management solution.
